# SaltStack Open Source Skills Workshop

## Background

From 2018 - 2020, following the successful release of SaltStack SecOps, SaltStack expanded its training offerings to accommodate teams with a desire to specialize in use of SaltStack Enterprise and its UI; or salt (Open), the core CLI-based tool and its accompanying engines, modules, and binaries.  SaltStack offered the latter in the form of Salt Open Source Foundations (SOSF).

## Objectives

This workshop offers a condensed overview of the materials contained within the SOSF course with accompanying hands-on lab activities, and was originally written to support a live, remote workshop that is not publicly available.  The lab documents contained in this repository are a reflection of the activities relevant to this condensed-format workshop, but unlike much of the original SOSF lab documents, do not require access to a purpose-built lab environment; with minor adjustment, these labs can be exercised in nearly any salt environment.

Additionally, the workshop as presented in this repository will likely expand beyond the scope of the original workshop over time in an effort to address topics that were not addressed in the initial delivery, and public contribution is welcome with the caveat that SaltStack as an entity (now a part of VMware) and its designees will exercise merge control over the material contained herein.

### Audience

This workshop is directed at anyone, regardless of affiliation, discipline, or business relationship with VMware, who wishes to begin or continue their advancement in the use of salt, SaltStack Config, or SaltStack SecOps to meet goals in application system, infrastructure, and network management, particularly as they relate to workflow, automation, and orchestration.
